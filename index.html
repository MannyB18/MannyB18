   		<td> Animal: With this piece of art,I edited 3 different animals into one using photoshop. I used the legs of a cheetah, body of a gorilla and the head of a lion. I used the eraser and layer mask to overlap layers and make the parts of the animals to connect.  </td>
   		<td>2PAC: This art piece was made in a way of taking a picture of a celebrity or myself, and I chose to use 2pac. 2Pac was a legendary hip-hop artist in which inspires me. In photoshop, I gave him a holy touch background and I colored his skin tone and jewelry. The outcome came out as if 2Pac was sort of like a cartoon. </td>
   		<td>Future: For this art design, I chose another celebrity which was Future. In this image, I took one of Future's self image and changed his skin color and background to two main colors, blue and green which made his face pop out more.</td>
